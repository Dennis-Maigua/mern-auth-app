# Overview:

Mern-Auth-App is a React-Native (cross-platform) application that runs on both Android and iOS smartphones.

### Key Features:

- **Sign Up**: allows users to create a new account by providing necessary details like username, email, and password.
- **Email Authentication**: involves sending a verification email containing a unique otp or code to the provided email address.
- **Login**: allows registered users to log in to their accounts using their credentials (email and password).
- **Forgot Password**: allows users to enter their email and receive a unique reset password token or link to reset their password.

# Environment and Setup:

>**Note**: Make sure you have installed the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) before proceeding.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Copy the project to your local machine (Desktop):

```bash
    $ cd Desktop
    $ git clone https://github.com/Dennis-Maigua/mern-auth-app.git
    $ exit
```

### 2. Run the Application, Backend, and Frontend

Open the project folders in 3 terminals, install their packages/dependencies, and run them seperately:

- Terminal 1 (Backend/Server):

```bash
    # using npm
    $ cd Destop/mern-auth-app/backend
    $ npm i
    $ npm start

    # OR using Yarn
    $ cd Desktop/mern-auth-app/backend
    $ yarn i
    $ yarn start
```

- Terminal 2 (Frontend/Client):

```bash
    # using npm
    $ cd Destop/mern-auth-app/frontend
    $ npm i
    $ npm start

    # OR using Yarn
    $ cd Desktop/mern-auth-app/frontend
    $ yarn i
    $ yarn start
```

- Terminal 3 (Application/Mobile App):

```bash
    # using npm
    $ cd Destop/mern-auth-app/application
    $ npm i
    $ npm start

    # OR using Yarn
    $ cd Desktop/mern-auth-app/application
    $ yarn i
    $ yarn start
```

### 3. Run the Metro Server (the JavaScript _bundler_ for React Native)

On Terminal 3 (Application/Mobile App), press the <kbd>a</kbd> key to run the app on `Android`, or press the <kbd>i</kbd> key to run the app on `iOS`.

- For Android

```bash
    $ a
```

- For iOS

```bash
    $ i
```

### 4. (Optional) Update the Packages/Dependencies

If you want to keep all packages and dependencies up-to-date, run on each terminal:

```bash
    # using npm
    $ npm i -g npm-check-updates
    $ ncu -u
    $ npm install

    # OR using Yarn
    $ yarn i -g yarn-check-updates
    $ ncu -u
    $ yarn install
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly provided you have set it up correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within your Smartphone/Mobile Device, or Android Studio, and Xcode respectively.
